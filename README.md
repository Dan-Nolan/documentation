# âœ¨ Introduction

PoolTogether is a protocol for no-loss prize games on the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol: 

**1\) Enables developers to build their own prize games  
2\)** **Offers governance-managed prize games**

Prize games are pools of funds whose accrued interest is distributed as prizes. Modeled on the well established concept of "[no loss lotteries](http://beniverson.org/papers/MaMa.pdf)" and "[prize savings accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prize-linked_savings_account)" all prize games created by the protocol share the same key characteristics:

* No loss of deposited funds
* Ability to withdraw at any time
* Fair prize distribution according to a prize strategy

Prize games can be differentiated in the following ways: 

* The yield source the prize pool uses to generate no loss return
* The prize strategy used to determine frequency and distribution of prizes 
* The additional rewards offered by the prize pool
* The asset type the prize pool accepts for deposits 
* The fairness parameters 

The first type of prize game offered by PoolTogether implements the [Single Random Winner](protocol/prize-strategy/single-random-winner/) prize strategy. More are coming!

## Governance

The PoolTogether Protocol governance serves two primary functions. 

* Governing the prize pool creation tools
* Governing a sub-set of prize pools

The protocol governed prize pools appear on the official [PoolTogether App](https://app.pooltogether.com).  Governance is currently the core PoolTogether team, but very soon governance control will be distributed amongst protocol stakeholders.
