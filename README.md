# Introduction

PoolTogether is a protocol for no loss prize games on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables the creation of pools of funds whose accrued interest is distributed as prizes.

The protocol is modelled on the well established concept of "[no loss lotteries](http://beniverson.org/papers/MaMa.pdf)" and "[prize savings accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prize-linked_savings_account)" and shares the same key characteristics:

* No loss of deposited funds 
* Ability to withdraw a deposit at any time 
* Fairness of prize distribution
