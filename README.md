# ðŸŽº Introduction

PoolTogether is a protocol for no-loss **prize games** on the Ethereum blockchain.

ðŸ› **Enables developers to build their own prize games.**  
ðŸ‘‘**Offers governance-managed prize games**

## Prize Games

Prize games are pools of funds whose accrued interest is distributed as prizes. ****Prize games all share the same key characteristics:

* No loss of deposited funds
* Ability to withdraw at any time
* Prizes are distributed according to a **prize strategy**

The first type of prize game in PoolTogether is the no-loss lottery: also known as a [prize savings account](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prize-linked_savings_account) \(wikipedia\).  This is the [Single Random Winner](protocol/prize-strategy/single-random-winner.md) prize strategy.

## Governance

The PoolTogether Protocol also governs its own set of prize games.  These games are shown on the official [PoolTogether App](https://app.pooltogether.com) and are managed by PoolTogether governance.  Governance is currently the core PoolTogether team, but very soon governance control will be distributed amongst PoolTogether stakeholders.
