# Introduction

PoolTogether is a protocol for no loss prize games on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables the creation of pools of funds whose accrued interest is distributed according to a "prize strategy". 

The protocol is modeled on the well established concept of "[no loss lotteries](http://beniverson.org/papers/MaMa.pdf)" and "[prize savings accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prize-linked_savings_account)" and shares the same key characteristics:

* No loss of deposited funds 
* Ability to withdraw a deposit at any time 
* Fairness of prize distribution

Users of the protocol deposit funds into a "prize pool" and receive tickets. Tickets represent both the amount of the underlying asset and a chance to win. Prizes are made up from the yield earned on all deposited funds. The yield is allocated according to the "prize strategy". The prize strategy can define any logic for any to allocated any tokens the prize pool accrues. Everyone has a chance to win and no one loses.

Prize Pools created by the protocol can be differentiated in four primary ways: 

* The yield source the prize pool uses to generate no loss return
* The prize strategy used to determine frequency and distribution 
* The rewards offered to referrals and depositors  
* The asset type the prize pool accepts for deposits
