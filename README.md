# Introduction

PoolTogether is a protocol for no loss prize games on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables the creation of pools of funds whose accrued interest is distributed according to a "prize strategy". 

The protocol is modeled on the well established concept of "[no loss lotteries](http://beniverson.org/papers/MaMa.pdf)" and "[prize savings accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prize-linked_savings_account)" and shares the same key characteristics:

* No loss of deposited funds 
* Ability to withdraw a deposit at any time 
* Fairness of prize distribution

Users of the protocol deposit funds into a "prize pool" and receive tickets. Tickets represent both the amount of the underlying asset and a chance to win. Prizes are made up from the yield earned on all deposited funds thus insuring a user can always recover their original deposit. Everyone has a chance to win and no one loses.

Prize Pools created by the protocol can be differentiated in four primary ways: 

* The yield source the prize pool uses to generate no loss return
* The prize strategy used to determine prize distribution 
* The frequency prizes are awarded 
* The asset type the prize pool accepts for deposits
