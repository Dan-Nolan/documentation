# Introduction

PoolTogether is a protocol for no-loss prize games on the Ethereum blockchain.  Prize games are pools of funds whose accrued interest is distributed as prizes.  The protocol governs a set of prize games and also enables developers to build their own.

Prize games all share the same key characteristics:

* No loss of deposited funds 
* Ability to withdraw a deposit at any time 
* Fairness of play

The first type of prize game in PoolTogether is the no-loss lottery: also known as a [prize savings account](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prize-linked_savings_account).
