# Overview

The core PoolTogether protocol consists of Prize Pools, Prize Strategies and Prize Pool Builders.  The code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/pooltogether/pooltogether-contracts).

### Prize Pools

The core primitive in PoolTogether is the Prize Pool, which manages ticket purchases, ticket redemptions, and the prize distribution strategy.

### Prize Strategies

When a Prize Pool is created it is configured with a Prize Strategy.  The [Prize Strategy](prize-strategy.md) determines how prizes are distributed.

### Prize Pool Builders





Prize Pool Builders allow users to easily create preconfigured Prize Pools.  There is a builder to create Single Randomly Selected Winner Prize Pools, and one to create Prize Pools with a custom prize strategy.
