# üèõÔ∏è Overview

_The PoolTogether protocol will be transitioning to decentralized governance.  In the meantime, the core team serves as the interim governance body._

PoolTogether Governance broadly serves two mandates:

* Protocol improvement
* Prize Pool management

## Protocol Improvement

Governance will guide the evolution of the protocol.  Improvements may include:

* [rewards](untitled.md) for prize pool users
* new yield sources for prize pools 
* new prize strategies
* additional prizes or rewards
* integrations with L2 systems
* subsidized transactions
* insurance coverage

All Prize Pools created with [Builders](../protocol/builders/) contribute a small fee to the **protocol reserve**.  The reserve is retained by the protocol as sponsorship in the Prize Pool in which it accrued.

## Prize Pool Management

Governance also manages its own set of Prize Pools.  These Prize Pools are displayed on the official [PoolTogether App](https://app.pooltogether.com).

## Comptroller

All Prize Pools link to a global protocol Comptroller.  The Comptroller is owned by governance, and determines the reserve rate and rewards Prize Pools.
