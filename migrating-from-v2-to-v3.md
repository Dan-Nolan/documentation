# ðŸ’± Migrating from V2 to V3

Users of PoolTogether V2 can exchange their old tickets for new ones using the [new interface](https://app.pooltogether.com).  See the "accounts" section.

Users can exchange:

* Dai Pool tickets
* USDC Pool tickets
* Dai Pod tickets
* USDC Pod tickets

All of these tickets will be exchange 1:1 for new V3 Pool Dai tickets.  Note that you will not receive USDC back, you will be **exchanging your USDC Tickets for Dai Tickets**.

The migration contract needs to be stocked with liquidity, so if your ticket exchange fails please contact us on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/hxPhPDW).
