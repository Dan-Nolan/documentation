# üåê Overview

The PoolTogether Protocol 

## How it works

1. Users deposit funds into a Prize Pool.  They receive tokens in exchange.
2. The funds earn interest.
3. The interest is distributed by the Prize Strategy as tokens.
4. Users withdraw their funds by telling the Prize Pool to burn their tokens.

## Brief

Users of the protocol deposit funds into a "prize pool" and receive tickets. Tickets represent both the amount of the underlying asset and a chance to win. Prizes are made up from the yield earned on all deposited funds. The yield is allocated according to the "prize strategy". The prize strategy can define any logic to allocate tokens the prize pool accrues. Everyone has a chance to win and no one loses.

Prize Pools created by the protocol can be differentiated in four primary ways: 

* The yield source the prize pool uses to generate no loss return
* The prize strategy used to determine frequency and distribution 
* The rewards offered to referrals and depositors  
* The asset type the prize pool accepts for deposits 

## Get started by

### [Buying Tickets in a Prize Pool](../tutorials/buying-tickets.md)

### Proposing to Governance:

* new prize pools
* new prize distribution strategies
* new yield sources for prize pools 
* anything you want.

The management of the protocol is facilitated via the Governor and Comptroller contracts. The core value of the protocol is facilitated by the Prize Pools, Prize Strategies and Prize Pool Builder contracts. The code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/pooltogether/pooltogether-contracts).

## Architecture

### [Prize Pool](prize-pool/)

The core primitive in PoolTogether is the Prize Pool, which manages ticket purchases, ticket redemptions, sponsorship, yield generation, and exposes the interest earned to the prize strategy.  

\*Prize Pools are not upgradeable, and have no admin functions other than an emergency shutdown.\*

### [Prize Strategy](prize-strategy/)

When a Prize Pool is created it is configured with a Prize Strategy.  The [Prize Strategy](prize-strategy/) determines how prizes are distributed, the early withdrawal exit fee for users, and the timelocked withdrawal duration.  The Prize Strategy is upgradeable and governed by the owner of the pool.

### [Prize Pool Builder](builders/)

The Prize Pool Builder generates new prize pools. The creation of new prize pools are initiated by the governor contract. Because prize pools are not upgradeable the yield generation source is set when the pool is created.

### [Comptroller](../governance/comptroller.md)

The comptroller sets the global reserve rate and manages the protocol reserves. The reserve rate is a global parameter that takes a percent of the yield accrued on a prize pool. 

### [Governor](../governance/governor.md)

The governor contract manages the protocol. As of September 1st 2020 the governor contract is managed by the PoolTogether Inc team. Management of this contract and the protocol itself will be decentralized.  

## Gas Station Network

PoolTogether supports the [Gas Station Network 2.0](https://github.com/opengsn/gsn).  The Gas Station Network is an open source system for meta-transactions on Ethereum.  The GSN consists of smart contracts, relayers, and a protocol to support a decentralized meta transaction relayer network.

The PoolTogether smart contracts support GSNv2 by inheriting from the [BaseRelayRecipient](https://github.com/opengsn/gsn/blob/master/contracts/BaseRelayRecipient.sol) contract and being bound to a trusted forwarder.  The contracts are tooled so that they support GSN transactions.

The contracts that support the GSN are:

* [Prize Pools](prize-pool/)
* [Prize Strategies](prize-strategy/)
* [Tickets](ticket.md)

The PoolTogether contracts on Kovan are bound to the [TrustedForwarder deployed by the GSN](https://docs.opengsn.org/gsn-provider/networks.html).
