# ðŸ’¸ Prize Strategies

A Prize Strategy handles prize distribution for a [Prize Pool](../prize-pool/).  When a Prize Pool is constructed it is configured with a Prize Strategy.  The Prize Strategy has the privileged ability to award tokens from the Prize Pool.

The first Prize Strategy PoolTogether is offering is the [Single Random Winner](single-random-winner.md) strategy.
