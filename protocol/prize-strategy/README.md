# ðŸ’¸ Prize Strategies

A Prize Strategy handles prize distribution for a [Prize Pool](../prize-pool/).  When a Prize Pool is constructed it is configured with a Prize Strategy.  

Currently there is one prize strategy -- "Single Random Winner". However, 

The Prize Strategy created by the [Compound Prize Pool Builder](../builders/) is upgradeable by the governor contract.
