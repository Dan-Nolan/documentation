# 🎟️ Tokens

When users deposit into a Prize Pool they receive an ERC20 compatible [ticket](ticket.md).

External ERC721 and ERC20's can also be [added, controlled and removed](../prize-strategy/multiple-winners.md#external-erc20-and-erc721-awards) by Prize Pools.

[Sponsorship](sponsorship.md) tokens are created when funds are added to the pool that are not eligible to win any prizes.
