# Audits & Testing

The PoolTogether Protocol has undergone two formal professional third party audits conducted by Open Zeppelin. [Those audits can be viewed here](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/pooltogether-v3-audit/). 

Additionally there is an on-going audit being conducted by [Ditcraft](https://www.ditcraft.io/) and the PoolTogether core team has a long term security relationship with [ConsenSys Diligence](https://diligence.consensys.net/audits/). 

Notwithstanding, portions of the PoolTogether Protocol codebase will continue to evolve and **it should never be expected that 100% of the deployed code has been formally audited.**

We encourage responsible disclosure of any vulnerabilities in the smart contracts and will pay up to $25,000 for those.  See the [Bounties](bounties.md) for more details.
