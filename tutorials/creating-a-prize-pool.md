# Create a Prize Pool

The easiest way to create a prize game is by using our [Builder App](https://builder.pooltogether.com).  The Builder app is supported across all testnets.  The Builder is an interface to the [Compound Prize Pool Builder](../protocol/builders/compound-prize-pool-builder.md).  


Alternatively, you can call an on-chain Builder such as the [Compound Prize Pool Builder](../protocol/builders/compound-prize-pool-builder.md).
