# ðŸŽ¨ NFT Art Giveaway

An artist could use a Stake Prize Pool to giveaway a piece of their art each month.  The artist could require that the users stake their personal token for a chance to win.  

1. Users stake artist's personal token in the prize pool
2. Artist adds NFT to the prize pool
3. NFT is awarded randomly to a staked user!

**This would drive demand for the personal token; so that users can participate in this giveaway.**
